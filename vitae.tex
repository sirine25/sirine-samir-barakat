%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.

%%% HEADING AT TOP OF CURRICULUM VITAE

% The title (name) with a horizontal rule under it
% (optional argument typesets an object right-justified across from name
%  as well)
%
% Usage: \makeheading{name}
%        OR
%        \makeheading[right_object]{name}
%
% Place at top of document. It should be the first thing.
% If ``right_object'' is provided in the square-braced optional
% argument, it will be right justified on the same line as ``name'' at
% the top of the CV. For example:
%
%       \makeheading[\emph{Curriculum vitae}]{Your Name}
%
% will put an emphasized ``Curriculum vitae'' at the top of the document
% as a title. Likewise, a picture could be included:
%
%   \makeheading[{\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{my_picture}}]{Your Name}
%
% the picture will be flush right across from the name. For this example
% to work, make sure the extra set of curly braces is included. Also
% makes ure that \usepackage{graphicx} is somewhere in the preamble.

\section{Summary}

Samer has a strong background in machine learning (both classical and deep methods), computer graphics, image processing, simulation, control theory and robotics. Current interests include tracking and mapping (SLAM), localization at scale, sensor fusion, large scale 3D reconstruction, object detection/tracking, and navigation and path planning for robotics. Managed a team of engineers, and interfaced with both external customers, discussing deliveries and timeline, in addition to internal cross-functional groups for QA, acquisitions, power / performance, application development and user experience scientists. Hands-on coding with a wide variety of development environments, architectures, languages and tools.
